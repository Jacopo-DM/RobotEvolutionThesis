This Context Raises the Question: How Do Gait Learning Algorithms Compare When Applied to Various Morphologies That Are Not Known in Advance (thus Need to Be Treated without Priors)? Akin to Using Different Data Sets to Compare Learning Algorithms in Machine Learning, We Use a Test Suite of Twenty Different Morphologies to Evaluate Our Gait Learners and Compare Their Efficiency, the Efficacy and to Morphological Differences. The Results Indicate That Bayesian Optimization, Sensitivity and Differential Evolution Deliver the Same Solution Quality (walking Speed for the Robot) with Fewer Evaluations Than the Evolution Strategy. Furthermore, the Efficiency of the Evolution Strategy Varies More between Different Morphologies and Is More Subject to Luck, I.e., Repeated Runs on the Same Morphology Show Greater Variance in the Outcomes.},

However, an Empirical Assessment Is Still Lacking To-Date. In This Paper We Investigate the Effects of Such a Learning Mechanism from Different Perspectives. Using Extensive Simulations We Show That Learning Can Greatly Increase Task Performance and Reduce the Number of Generations Required to Reach a Certain Fitness Level Compared to the Purely Evolutionary Approach. Furthermore, We Demonstrate That the Evolved Morphologies Will Be Also Different, Even Though Learning Only Directly Affects the Controllers. This Provides a Quantitative Demonstration That Changes in the Brain Can Induce Changes in the Body. Finally We Examine the Learning Delta Defined As the Performance Difference between the Inherited and the Learned Brain and Find That It Is Growing Throughout the Evolutionary Process. This Shows That Evolution Produces Robots with an Increasing Plasticity, That Is, Consecutive Generations Become Better Learners and , Consequently, They Perform Better at the Given Task. Moreover Our Results Demonstrate That the Triangle of Life Is Not Only a Concept of Theoretical Interest but a System Methodology with Practical Benefits.},

  abstract = {A Novel System for Creating Virtual Creatures That Move, This Paper Describes and in Simulated Three-Dimensional Physical Worlds. The Morphologies of Creatures, Behave and the Neural Systems for Controlling Their Muscle Forces Are Both Generated Automatically Using Genetic Algorithms. Different Fitness Evaluation Functions Are Used to Direct Simulated Evolutions Towards Specific Behaviors Such As Swimming, Walking, Jumping and Nodes, Following. A. Genetic Language Is Presented That Uses and Connections As Its Primitive Elements to Represent Directed Graphs, Which Are Used to Describe Both the Morphology and the Neural Circuitry of These Creatures. This Genetic Language Defines a Hyperspace Containing an Indefinite Number of Possible Creatures with Behaviors and When It Is Searched Using Optimization Techniques, a Variety of Successful and Interesting Locomotion Strategies Emerge, Some of Which Would Be Difficult to Invent or Build by Design.},

  year     = {2007},
  abstract = {Natural Dna Can Encode Complexity on an Enormous Scale. Researchers Are Attempting to Achieve the Same Representational Efficiency in Computers by Implementing Developmental Encodings, I.e. Encodings That Map the Genotype to the Phenotype through a Process of Growth from a Small Starting Point to a Mature Form. A Major Challenge in in This Effort Is to Find the Right Level of Abstraction of Biological Development to Capture Its Essential Properties without Introducing Unnecessary Inefficiencies. In This Paper, a Novel Abstraction of Natural Development Called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (cppns) Is Proposed. Unlike Currently Accepted Abstractions Such As Iterative Rewrite Systems and Cellular Growth Simulations, Cppns Map to the Phenotype without Local Interaction, That Is Each Individual Component of the Phenotype Is Determined Independently of Every Other Component. Results Produced with Cppns through Interactive Evolution of Two-Dimensional Images Show That Such an Encoding Can Nevertheless Produce Structural Motifs Often Attributed to More Conventional Developmental Abstractions Suggesting That Local Interaction May Not Be Essential to the Desirable Properties of Natural Encoding in the Way That Is Usually Assumed.},
